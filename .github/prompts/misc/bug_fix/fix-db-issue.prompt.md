The database integration is not working as expected. Please check the following:

1. Ensure that the database server is running.
2. Verify the database connection settings in the configuration file.
3. Check the application logs for any error messages related to database operations.
4. If using Docker, ensure that the database container is running and accessible.

Once you have checked these items, try to reproduce the issue and gather any error messages or logs that can help in diagnosing the problem.
